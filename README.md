# Dice Simulation and Statistics Project

This Java project demonstrates basic programming concepts using three different types of loops (`while`, `do-while`, and `for`) to simulate the rolling of two dice 10,000 times. It also includes a program for reading numerical data from a file and calculating statistical metrics.

## Files Included

- `DiceSimulation.java`  
  Simulates 10,000 dice rolls using a `while` loop and counts how often doubles (two of the same number) occur.

- `DiceSimulationDoWhileLoop.java`  
  Same simulation using a `do-while` loop.

- `DiceSimulationForLoop.java`  
  Same simulation using a `for` loop.

- `StatsDemo.java`  
  Reads a list of numbers from a file (`Numbers.txt`), calculates the mean and standard deviation, and writes the results to `Results.txt`.

- `Numbers.txt`  
  Sample input file with numerical values for the statistics demo.

- `Results.txt`  
  Output file generated by `StatsDemo.java` containing calculated mean and standard deviation.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Loop control structures (`while`, `do-while`, `for`)
- Random number generation
- File input/output (I/O)
- Basic statistical calculations (mean, standard deviation)
- Conditional logic and switch statements
